### Bugfixes

!!! bug "bugfix - PR [#190](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/koheesio/pull/190), related issue #188"
    #### Fixed Parameter Handling in Database Connections
    
    Fixed an issue where query and table parameters weren't being properly handled in JDBC readers, particularly affecting Snowflake operations. The fix ensures:
    - Proper precedence between query and dbtable parameters
    - Correct parameter inheritance in nested database operations
    - Prevention of duplicate or conflicting parameters in options dictionaries
