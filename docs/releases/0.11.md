### Bugfixes

!!! bug "bugfix - PR [#TBD](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/koheesio/pull/TBD), related issue [#226](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/koheesio/issues/226)"
    #### *Core > Context*: Handle Path objects gracefully in `Context.from_yaml()`

    Fixed a bug where `Context.from_yaml()` would raise a confusing `AttributeError: 'PosixPath' object has no attribute 'read'` when passed a `pathlib.Path` object pointing to a non-existent file.

    **Root Cause:**  
    When a Path object for a non-existent file was passed to `from_yaml()`, the method would skip reading the file (since it doesn't exist), but would then pass the Path object directly to `yaml.load()`. The YAML parser tried to call `.read()` on the Path object, causing an AttributeError.

    **Fix:**  
    Added an `else` clause to convert Path objects to strings when the file doesn't exist, matching the existing pattern used in `Context.from_toml()`. This prevents the AttributeError and allows the YAML parser to handle the stringified path appropriately.

    **Impact:**  
    This bug was commonly encountered where configuration files might be missing due to environment misconfiguration. The error message was confusing and didn't clearly indicate that a file was missing. Now, the error handling is more graceful and consistent with the `from_toml()` method.

    **Test Coverage:**  
    Added comprehensive test (`test_from_yaml_path_object_nonexistent_file`) to verify the fix and prevent regression.

### Features

!!! feature "enhancement - PR [#TBD](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/koheesio/pull/TBD)"
    #### *Core > Models*: New NestedEnum utility for case-insensitive nested enums
    
    Added a new `NestedEnum` utility to `koheesio.models` enabling clean, case-insensitive
    nested enum structures. Both metaclass and decorator syntax supported.
    
    **Key Features:**
    - Case-insensitive access: `OutputMode.BATCH.APPEND`, `OutputMode.batch.APPEND`, `OutputMode.Batch.APPEND` all work
    - One-time normalization at class creation (no runtime overhead)
    - Collision detection prevents duplicate nested classes with different casing
    - Compatible with Pydantic models and Python's `enum.Enum`
    
    **Usage:**
    ```python
    from koheesio.models import nested_enum
    from enum import Enum
    
    @nested_enum
    class OutputMode:
        class BATCH(str, Enum):
            APPEND = "append"
            OVERWRITE = "overwrite"
        
        class STREAMING(str, Enum):
            APPEND = "append"
            COMPLETE = "complete"
    
    # All case variations work:
    mode = OutputMode.BATCH.APPEND
    mode = OutputMode.batch.APPEND  # Also works!
    mode = OutputMode.Batch.OVERWRITE  # Also works!
    ```
    
    **Refactored OutputMode enums:**
    - New nested structure: `OutputMode.BATCH.*` and `OutputMode.STREAMING.*`
    - Backward compatibility aliases: `BatchOutputMode` and `StreamingOutputMode` still work
    - No breaking changes to existing code
    - All existing writer tests pass
    
    **Implementation Details:**
    - Uses a custom metaclass (`NestedEnumMeta`) that normalizes nested class names to uppercase at class creation time
    - Provides case-insensitive access by trying normalized (uppercase) lookup first, then exact match
    - Simple, clean implementation with minimal overhead
