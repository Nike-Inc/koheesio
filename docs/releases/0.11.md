    #### *Snowflake*: Fixed table parameter duplication in options dictionary

    Fixed an issue in `SnowflakeBaseModel.get_options()` where the 'table' parameter was being included in the options dictionary, causing conflicts in nested operations like `AddColumn` during schema synchronization. The fix excludes the table parameter while maintaining proper parameter handling for Snowflake connections, ensuring that operations can properly cascade options without parameter conflicts.

    #### *Core > Context*: Handle Path objects gracefully in `Context.from_yaml()`

    Fixed a bug where `Context.from_yaml()` would raise a confusing `AttributeError: 'PosixPath' object has no attribute 'read'` when passed a `pathlib.Path` object pointing to a non-existent file.

    **Root Cause:**  
    When a Path object for a non-existent file was passed to `from_yaml()`, the method would skip reading the file (since it doesn't exist), but would then pass the Path object directly to `yaml.load()`. The YAML parser tried to call `.read()` on the Path object, causing an AttributeError.

    **Fix:**  
    Added an `else` clause to convert Path objects to strings when the file doesn't exist, matching the existing pattern used in `Context.from_toml()`. This prevents the AttributeError and allows the YAML parser to handle the stringified path appropriately.

    **Impact:**  
    This bug was commonly encountered where configuration files might be missing due to environment misconfiguration. The error message was confusing and didn't clearly indicate that a file was missing. Now, the error handling is more graceful and consistent with the `from_toml()` method.

    **Test Coverage:**  
    Added comprehensive test (`test_from_yaml_path_object_nonexistent_file`) to verify the fix and prevent regression.
