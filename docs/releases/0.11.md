    #### *Snowflake*: Fixed table parameter duplication in options dictionary

    Fixed an issue in `SnowflakeBaseModel.get_options()` where the 'table' parameter was being included in the options dictionary, causing conflicts in nested operations like `AddColumn` during schema synchronization. The fix excludes the table parameter while maintaining proper parameter handling for Snowflake connections, ensuring that operations can properly cascade options without parameter conflicts. The implementation also improves overall parameter handling across the Snowflake and JDBC reader classes while maintaining backwards compatibility.
