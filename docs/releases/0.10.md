# Koheesio 0.10

Version 0.10 is Koheesio's 4th release since getting Open Sourced.

This version brings several important features, security improvements, and bug fixes across different modules of Koheesio. The overall API remains unchanged.

## New Contributors

Big shout out to all contributors and a heartfelt welcome to our new contributors:

* @nogitting made their first contribution in https://github.com/Nike-Inc/koheesio/pull/154
* @zarembat made their first contribution in https://github.com/Nike-Inc/koheesio/pull/163

## Migrating from v0.9

For users currently using v0.9, consider the following:

* Consider switching to the new `SecretStr` and `SecretBytes` classes for handling secret strings and bytes with enhanced security. These classes are compatible with Pydantic's SecretStr and SecretBytes and allow seamless integration with existing code. To use, replace `from pydantic import SecretStr, SecretBytes` with `from koheesio.models import SecretStr, SecretBytes` to use the enhanced secret handling. This is especially useful if you find yourself needing to format secret strings or bytes (i.e. concatenation, f-strings, etc.) while maintaining security.

* The `partial` classmethod was added to `BaseModel` for enhanced customization and flexibility. This method allows creating a new instance of a model with only the specified fields updated, such as overwriting or setting a field's default values. This feature provides more control over the model's behavior and allows for more dynamic model creation.

* The `HttpStep` class now supports authorization headers with proper masking for improved security. This change addresses potential data leaks in authorization headers, ensuring secure handling of sensitive information. Comprehensive unit tests have been added to prevent regressions and ensure expected behavior. Consider updating your `HttpStep` implementations to take advantage of this enhanced security feature.

* `JDBCReader`, `HanaReader`, and `TeradataReader` classes have been updated to use `params` over `options` for improved consistency and maintainability. The `options` field has been renamed to `params`, and an alias `options` has been added for backwards compatibility. These changes provide a more consistent API across different reader classes and improve code readability. Note that `dbtable` and `query` validation now occurs upon *initialization* rather than at *runtime*, requiring either `dbtable` or `query` to be submitted to use JDBC based classes.

### Features and Enhancements

The following new features are included with 0.10:

!!! abstract "feature - PR [#164](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/koheesio/pull/164)"
    #### *Core*: Added Koheesio specific `SecretStr` and `SecretBytes` classes

    Allows formatting secret strings and bytes with enhanced security.  
    To use: replace `from pydantic import SecretStr, SecretBytes` with `from koheesio.models import SecretStr, SecretBytes` in your import statement.

    * New Secret classes are compatible with Pydantic's `SecretStr` and  `SecretBytes` and allow seamless integration with existing code.
    * These classes expand support to allow usage with an f-string (or `.format`) and `"string" +  "other_string"` concatenation while remaining secure. Concatenations are not supported by Pydantic's `SecretStr` and `SecretBytes` implementations.
    * A `SecretMixin` class was also introduced to reduce code duplication.

    #### *Core > BaseModel*: Added `partial` classmethod to `BaseModel`

    Partial allows for creating a new instance of a model with only the specified fields updated (such as overwriting or setting a fields default values)

    #### *Box*: Added a buffered version of `BoxFileWriter` and improved logging for `BoxCsvFileReader`
  
    Added the `BoxBufferFileWriter` class for writing files to Box when physical storage isn't available. Data is instead buffered in memory before being written to Box. Also improves `BoxCsvFileReader` logging output by providing the file name in addition to the file ID.

    #### *Dev Experience*: Easier debugging and dev improvements
  
    To make debugging easier, `pyproject.toml` was updated to allow for easier running `spark connect` in your local dev environment:

    * Added extra dependencies for `pyspark[connect]==3.5.4`.
    * Added environment variables for Spark Connect in the development environment.
    * Changed to verbose mode logging in the pytest output (also visible through Github Actions tests run output).

    #### *Delta*: Support for Delta table history and data staleness checks

    Enables fetching Delta table history and checking data staleness based on defined intervals and refresh days.
    
    Changes to `DeltaTableStep` class:

    * Added `describe_history()` method to `DeltaTableStep` for fetching Delta table history as a Spark DataFrame.
    * Added `is_date_stale()` method to `DeltaTableStep` to check data staleness based on time intervals or specific refresh days.

    #### *Http*: Added support for authorization headers with proper masking for improved security

    Addresses potential data leaks in authorization headers, ensuring secure handling of sensitive information. Comprehensive unit tests added to prevent regressions and ensure expected behavior.

    Changes to `HttpStep` class:

    * Added `decode_sensitive_headers` method to decode `SecretStr` values in headers.
    * Modified `get_headers` method to dump headers into JSON without `SecretStr` masking.
    * Added `auth_header` field to handle authorization headers.
    * Implemented masking for bearer tokens to maintain their 'secret' status.

    #### *Step & Spark*: Added Step for downloading files from a URL along with matching Spark transformation

    * The spark implementation allows passing URLs through a column in a given DataFrame
    * All URLs are then downloaded by the Spark Driver to a given location

### Bugfixes

The following bugfixes are included with 0.10:

!!! bug "bugfix - PR [#160](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/koheesio/pull/160)"
    #### *Core > Context*: Fix Context initialization with another Context object and dotted notation

    * The `__init__` method of the `Context` class incorrectly updated the `kwargs` making it return `None`. Calls to `Context` containing another `Context` object, would previously fail.
    * Also fixed an issue with how `Context` handled get operations for nested keys when using dotted notation

!!! bug "bugfix - PR [#168](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/koheesio/pull/168), related issue: #167"
    #### *Core > Step*: Fixed duplicate logging issues in nested Step classes

    We observed log duplication when using specific super call sequences in nested Step classes.

    * Several changes were made to the `StepMetaClass` to address duplicate logs when using `super()` in the execute method of a Step class under specific circumstances.
    * Updated `_is_called_through_super` method to traverse the entire method resolution order (MRO) and correctly identify `super()` calls.
    * Ensured `_execute_wrapper` method triggers logging only once per execute call.
    
    This change prevents duplicate logs and ensures accurate log entries. The `_is_called_through_super` method was also used for `Output` validation; now we can ensure it is called only once.

    #### *Delta*: Improve merge clause handling in `DeltaTableWriter`

    *When using delta merge configuration (as dict) to provide merge condition to merge builder and having multiple calls for merge operation (e.g. for each batch processing in streaming), the original implementation was breaking due to a pop call on the used dictionary.

    * Connect support check previously excluded Spark 3.4 wrongfully
    * Fix gets rid of False positives in our spark connect check utility

!!! bug "bugfix - PR [#168](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/koheesio/pull/168)"
    #### *Spark > Transformation > Hash*: Fix error handling for missing columns in Spark Connect

    Updated `sha2` function call to use named parameters.
    
    Changes to `Sha2Hash` class:

    * Added check for missing columns.
    * Improved handling when no columns are provided.
