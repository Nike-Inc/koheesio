# Koheesio 0.10

Version 0.10 is Koheesio's 4th release since getting Open Sourced.

This version brings several important features, security improvements, and bug fixes across different modules of Koheesio. The overall API remains unchanged.

## New Contributors

Big shout out to all contributors and a heartfelt welcome to our new contributors:

* @nogitting made their first contribution in <https://github.com/Nike-Inc/koheesio/pull/154>
* @zarembat made their first contribution in <https://github.com/Nike-Inc/koheesio/pull/163>
* @brunodd made their first contribution in <https://github.com/Nike-Inc/koheesio/pull/180>

## Migrating from v0.9

For users currently using v0.9, consider the following:

* Consider switching to the new `SecretStr` and `SecretBytes` classes for handling secret strings and bytes with enhanced security. These classes are compatible with Pydantic's SecretStr and SecretBytes and allow seamless integration with existing code. To use, replace `from pydantic import SecretStr, SecretBytes` with `from koheesio.models import SecretStr, SecretBytes` to use the enhanced secret handling. This is especially useful if you find yourself needing to format secret strings or bytes (i.e. concatenation, f-strings, etc.) while maintaining security.

* The `partial` classmethod was added to `BaseModel` for enhanced customization and flexibility. This method allows creating a new instance of a model with only the specified fields updated, such as overwriting or setting a field's default values. This feature provides more control over the model's behavior and allows for more dynamic model creation.

* The `HttpStep` class now supports authorization headers with proper masking for improved security. This change addresses potential data leaks in authorization headers, ensuring secure handling of sensitive information. Comprehensive unit tests have been added to prevent regressions and ensure expected behavior. Consider updating your `HttpStep` implementations to take advantage of this enhanced security feature.

* `JDBCReader`, `HanaReader`, and `TeradataReader` classes have been updated to use `params` over `options` for improved consistency and maintainability. The `options` field has been renamed to `params`, and an alias `options` has been added for backwards compatibility. These changes provide a more consistent API across different reader classes and improve code readability. Note that `dbtable` and `query` validation now occurs upon *initialization* rather than at *runtime*, requiring either `dbtable` or `query` to be submitted to use JDBC based classes.

!!! bug "bugfix - PR [#203](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/koheesio/pull/203), related issue #203"
    #### *Spark*: ensure correct check of remote modules during retrieval of active Spark session

    Fixed a bug in logic for checking remote modules during retrieval of active Spark session.

!!! bug "bugfix - PR [#189](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/koheesio/pull/189), related issue #189"
    #### *HttpStep*: native retry mechanism

    The original implementation relied on the user providing the custom requests.Session object 
    with retries and backoff configured. This change embedds the retry mechanism into the class.
    Also some tests relied on the online service providing various endpoints to test 
    logic / connectivity / error handling / etc. 
    The lead to unstable tests. This PR also reworks the tests to leverage mocking for normal 
    and async HTTP classes and readers.

    #### *Snowflake*: SnowflakeReader it fails when dbtable is passed in my initialization

    Fixed a bug in jdbc reader to pass params as dbtable instead of table.

    User reported that when using SnowflakeReader it complains that either dbtable or query must be passed
    even if dbtable is passed in my initialization. This is only failing in databricks because databricks
    uses older version of snowflake driver which does not accept table as parameter.

!!! bug "bugfix - PR [#197](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/koheesio/pull/197), related issue #186"
    #### *Spark Connect*: Spark connect detection for imports

    Fixed a bug while getting remote session for spark-connect.

    Currently we are importing connect module only in case of spark session to be established as connect.
    Such approach leads to necessity of having spark session during imports.

!!! bug "bugfix - PR [#198](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/koheesio/pull/198), related issue #195"
    #### *Spark Connect*:  WindowSpec & Window typing is not wrapped for connect session

    Fixed a bug while getting WindowSpec and Window typing for spark-connect.

    For correct pydantic validation we need to wrap WindowSpec and Window typing for connect session and 
    local session as Union type when connect moduel is available, otherwise use only local version.

    #### *Databricks Connect*: allow SqlTransform for streaming dataframes with databricks-connect

    Fixed the bug by allowing SqlTransform for streaming dataframes with databricks-connect.

    databricks version of spark 3.5 supports SqlTransform on streaming dataframes unlike  opensource apache spark.

## Release 0.10.2

**v0.10.2** - *2025-04-02*

* **Full Changelog**:

!!! bug "bugfix - PR [#177](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/koheesio/pull/177), related issue #178"
    #### *Tableau*: Hyper process would fail on DBFS

    Fixed a bug causing the Hyper process to fail when DBFS was used as a target destination for the HyperAPI process. 

    Users reported that despite the fact that the process worked as expected on DBR 13.3, it was failing on 15.4.
    Hyper will now be generated using local filesystem in all cases and then it will be moved to the location that user 
    specified in the `path` parameter during class init, it could be DBFS or other compatible file system.

!!! bug "bugfix - PR [#179](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/koheesio/pull/179)"
    #### *Delta > Writer*: Fixed checking merge builder type in DeltaTableWriter when using connect

    * The `merge_builder` parameter in `DeltaTableWriter` was not properly validating the type of the merge builder when using Spark Connect.
    * The validation logic was expecting a `list` or a `delta.tables.DeltaMergeBuilder` instance, but it failed to recognize the `delta.connect.tables.DeltaMergeBuilder` instance.
    * 4 dedicated test cases have been added to test the merge builder

    <small> by @zarembat</small>

!!! bug "bugfix - PR [#180](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/koheesio/pull/180)"
    #### *Snowflake > Spark*: Ensure matched inserts sync to Snowflake

    * Ensure a new INSERT is synchronized to Snowflake, even when a match is already found.
    
    When a Delta table is VACUUMed before a sync to Snowflake was triggered, a updated record will be considered as an "INSERT" record. 
    However the target table might already contain this record. This fix ensures that this record is still updated as would be desired.

    <small> by @dannymeijer </small>  

!!! bug "bugfix - PR [#174](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/koheesio/pull/174)"
    #### *SSO > Okta*: Bug in `OktaAccessToken`

    Changes to HttpStep class caused `OktaAccessToken` to fail:
    
    * Fixed by switching `OktaAccessToken` to use `get_options` instead of a `model_validator`
    * Added several tests to ensure this doesn't happen again
    
    Additionally, fixed issue that might cause `client_secret` to be exposed in logs

### Features and Enhancements

The following new features are included with 0.10:

!!! abstract "feature - PR [#164](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/koheesio/pull/164)"
    #### *Core*: Added Koheesio specific `SecretStr` and `SecretBytes` classes

    Allows formatting secret strings and bytes with enhanced security.  
    To use: replace `from pydantic import SecretStr, SecretBytes` with `from koheesio.models import SecretStr, SecretBytes` in your import statement.

    * New Secret classes are compatible with Pydantic's `SecretStr` and  `SecretBytes` and allow seamless integration with existing code.
    * These classes expand support to allow usage with an f-string (or `.format`) and `"string" +  "other_string"` concatenation while remaining secure. Concatenations are not supported by Pydantic's `SecretStr` and `SecretBytes` implementations.
    * A `SecretMixin` class was also introduced to reduce code duplication.

### Bugfixes

The following bugfixes are included with 0.10:

!!! bug "bugfix - PR [#160](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/koheesio/pull/160)"
    #### *Core > Context*: Fix Context initialization with another Context object and dotted notation

    * The `__init__` method of the `Context` class incorrectly updated the `kwargs` making it return `None`. Calls to `Context` containing another `Context` object, would previously fail.
    * Also fixed an issue with how `Context` handled get operations for nested keys when using dotted notation

    <small> by @dannymeijer</small>

!!! bug "bugfix - PR [#168](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/koheesio/pull/168), related issue: #167"
    #### *Core > Step*: Fixed duplicate logging issues in nested Step classes

    We observed log duplication when using specific super call sequences in nested Step classes.

    * Several changes were made to the `StepMetaClass` to address duplicate logs when using `super()` in the execute method of a Step class under specific circumstances.
    * Updated `_is_called_through_super` method to traverse the entire method resolution order (MRO) and correctly identify `super()` calls.
    * Ensured `_execute_wrapper` method triggers logging only once per execute call.
    
    This change prevents duplicate logs and ensures accurate log entries. The `_is_called_through_super` method was also used for `Output` validation; now we can ensure it is called only once.

!!! bug "bugfix - PR [#155](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/koheesio/pull/155), related issue: #149"
    #### *Delta*: Improve merge clause handling in `DeltaTableWriter`

    *When using delta merge configuration (as dict) to provide merge condition to merge builder and having multiple calls for merge operation (e.g. for each batch processing in streaming), the original implementation was breaking due to a pop call on the used dictionary.

!!! bug "bugfix - PR [#154](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/koheesio/pull/154), related issue: #153"
    #### *Spark*: Pyspark Connect support fixes

    * Connect support check previously excluded Spark 3.4 wrongfully
    * Fix gets rid of False positives in our spark connect check utility

    <small> by @nogitting and @dannymeijer</small>

!!! bug "bugfix - PR [#142](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/koheesio/pull/142)"
    #### *Spark > ColumnsTransformation*: `ColumnConfig` defaults in `ColumnsTransformation` not working correctly by

    `run_for_all_data_type` and `limit_data_type` were previously not working correctly.

    <small> by @dannymeijer</small>

!!! bug "bugfix - PR [#168](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/koheesio/pull/168)"
    #### *Spark > Transformation > Hash*: Fix error handling for missing columns in Spark Connect

    Updated `sha2` function call to use named parameters.
    
    Changes to `Sha2Hash` class:

    * Added check for missing columns.
    * Improved handling when no columns are provided.
