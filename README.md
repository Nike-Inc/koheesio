# Koheesio: A Python Framework for Efficient Data Pipelines

Koheesio - the Finnish word for cohesion - is a robust Python framework designed to build efficient data pipelines. It
encourages modularity and collaboration, allowing the creation of complex pipelines from simple, reusable components.


## What is Koheesio?

Koheesio is a versatile framework that supports multiple implementations and works seamlessly with various data 
processing libraries or frameworks. This ensures that Koheesio can handle any data processing task, regardless of the
underlying technology or data scale.

Koheesio uses [Pydantic] for strong typing, data validation, and settings management, ensuring a high level of type
safety and structured configurations within pipeline components.

[Pydantic]: docs/includes/glossary.md#pydantic

The goal of Koheesio is to ensure predictable pipeline execution through a solid foundation of well-tested code and a
rich set of features. This makes it an excellent choice for developers and organizations seeking to build robust and
adaptable data pipelines.


### What Koheesio is Not

Koheesio is **not** a workflow orchestration tool. It does not serve the same purpose as tools like Luigi,
Apache Airflow, or Databricks workflows, which are designed to manage complex computational workflows and generate 
DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs).

Instead, Koheesio is focused on providing a robust, modular, and testable framework for data tasks. It's designed to
make it easier to write, maintain, and test data processing code in Python, with a strong emphasis on modularity,
reusability, and error handling.

If you're looking for a tool to orchestrate complex workflows or manage dependencies between different tasks, you might
want to consider dedicated workflow orchestration tools.


### The Strength of Koheesio

The core strength of Koheesio lies in its **focus on the individual tasks within those workflows**. It's all about
making these tasks as robust, repeatable, and maintainable as possible. Koheesio aims to break down tasks into small,
manageable units of work that can be easily tested, reused, and composed into larger workflows orchestrated with other
tools or frameworks (such as Apache Airflow, Luigi, or Databricks Workflows).

By using Koheesio, you can ensure that your data tasks are resilient, observable, and repeatable, adhering to good
software engineering practices. This makes your data pipelines more reliable and easier to maintain, ultimately leading
to more efficient and effective data processing.


### Promoting Collaboration and Innovation

Koheesio encapsulates years of software and data engineering expertise. It fosters a collaborative and innovative
community, setting itself apart with its unique design and focus on data pipelines, data transformation, ETL jobs,
data validation, and large-scale data processing.

The core components of Koheesio are designed to bring strong software engineering principles to data engineering. 

'Steps' break down tasks and workflows into manageable, reusable, and testable units. Each 'Step' comes with built-in
logging, providing transparency and traceability. The 'Context' component allows for flexible customization of task 
behavior, making it adaptable to various data processing needs.

In essence, Koheesio is a comprehensive solution for data engineering challenges, designed with the principles of
modularity, reusability, testability, and transparency at its core. It aims to provide a rich set of features including
utilities, readers, writers, and transformations for any type of data processing. It is not in competition with other
libraries, but rather aims to offer wide-ranging support and focus on utility in a multitude of scenarios. Our
preference is for integration, not competition.

We invite contributions from all, promoting collaboration and innovation in the data engineering community.


### Comparison to other libraries

#### ML frameworks

The libraries listed under this section are primarily focused on Machine Learning (ML) workflows. They provide various
functionalities, from orchestrating ML and data processing workflows, simplifying the deployment of ML workflows on 
Kubernetes, to managing the end-to-end ML lifecycle. While these libraries have a strong emphasis on ML, Koheesio is a 
more general data pipeline framework. It is designed to handle a variety of data processing tasks, not exclusively
focused on ML. This makes Koheesio a versatile choice for data pipeline construction, regardless of whether the
pipeline involves ML tasks or not.

#### Orchestration tools

The libraries listed under this section are primarily focused on workflow orchestration. They provide various 
functionalities, from authoring, scheduling, and monitoring workflows, to building complex pipelines of batch jobs, and 
creating and executing Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Some of these libraries are designed for modern infrastructure 
and powered by open-source workflow engines, while others use a Python-style language for defining workflows. While 
these libraries have a strong emphasis on workflow orchestration, Koheesio is a more general data pipeline framework. It
is designed to handle a variety of data processing tasks, not limited to workflow orchestration.Ccode written with
Koheesio is often compatible with these orchestration engines. This makes Koheesio a versatile choice for data pipeline 
construction, regardless of how the pipeline orchestration is set up.

- [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/): A platform to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows. Unlike Koheesio, it focuses on managing complex computational workflows.
- [Luigi](https://luigi.readthedocs.io/): A Python module that helps you build complex pipelines of batch jobs. It is more focused on workflow orchestration compared to Koheesio.
- [Databricks Workflows](https://www.databricks.com/product/workflows): A set of tools for building, debugging, deploying, and running Apache Spark workflows on Databricks.
- [Prefect](https://docs.prefect.io/): A new workflow management system, designed for modern infrastructure and powered by the open-source Prefect Core workflow engine. It is more focused on workflow orchestration and management compared to Koheesio.
- [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): A workflow management system that uses a Python-style language for defining workflows. While it's powerful for creating complex workflows, Koheesio's focus on modularity and reusability might make it easier to build, test, and maintain your data pipelines.
- [Dagster](https://docs.dagster.io/): A data orchestrator for machine learning, analytics, and ETL. It's more focused on orchestrating and visualizing data workflows compared to Koheesio.

- [Pachyderm](https://docs.pachyderm.com/): A data versioning, data lineage, and workflow system running on Kubernetes. It is more focused on data versioning and lineage compared to Koheesio.
- [Argo](https://argoproj.github.io/): An open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. Unlike Koheesio, it requires Kubernetes for deployment.


#### Others
  The libraries listed under this section offer a variety of unique functionalities, from parallel and distributed
  computing, to SQL-first transformation workflows, to data versioning and lineage, to data relation definition and
  manipulation, and data warehouse management. Some of these libraries are designed for specific tasks such as
  transforming data in warehouses using SQL, building concurrent, multi-stage data ingestion and processing pipelines, 
  or orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes.

- [Dask](https://dask.org/): A flexible parallel computing library for analytics. Unlike Koheesio, it is more focused on parallel computing and distributed computing. While not currently support, Dask could be a future implementation pattern for Koheesio, just like Pandas and PySpark at the moment. 
- [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/): A SQL-first transformation workflow that also supports Python. It excels in transforming data in warehouses using SQL. In contrast, Koheesio is a more general data pipeline framework with strong typing, capable of handling a variety of data processing tasks beyond transformations.
- [Broadway](https://elixir-broadway.org/): An Elixir library for building concurrent, multi-stage data ingestion and processing pipelines. If your team is more comfortable with Python or if you're looking for a framework that emphasizes modularity and collaboration, Koheesio could be a better fit.
