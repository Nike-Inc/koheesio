WARNING:  THIS WALK-THRU SHOWS HOW TO SOLVE THIS ADVENTURE STEP BY STEP, THESE
ARE NOT HINTS!

SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS ARE ENCLOSED IN QUOTES, SO TYPE WHAT YOU SEE.

START OFF BY GOING "N".  YOU ARE NOW STANDING AT THE END OF A ROAD BEFORE A
SMALL BRICK BUILDING.  THIS BUILDING IS THE WELLHOUSE, AND IS AN IMPORTANT PART
OF THE GAME.  THE OBJECT OF THIS GAME IS TO GET THE 15 TREASURES BACK TO THE
WELLHOUSE.

CONTINUE WITH "IN", AND YOU ARE INSIDE THE WELL HOUSE, SO "GET FOOD", "GET
LAMP", "GET KEYS", "GET BOTTLE".  NOW, THERE ARE THREE MAGIC WORDS YOU NEED TO
USE.  THEY ARE PLUGH, XYZZY AND PLOVER.  TWO OF THESE WORDS ARE USED TO GET TO
AND FROM THE WELLHOUSE AND PARTS OF THE CAVE.  THE THIRD, PLOVER IS USED TO GET
BETWEEN TWO PARTS OF THE CAVE.	ANOTHER THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT YOUR LAMP
LIGHT IS LIMITED, SO TURN OFF YOUR LAMP WHEN YOU DO NOT NEED IT!

NOW ON TO THE CAVE.  SAY "PLUGH", THEN "LAMP ON", "S", "GET SILVER", "DROP
KEYS", "DROP FOOD", "DROP BOTTLE", "N".  YOU ARE NOW BACK AT Y2.  HERE IS WHERE
YOU USE PLOVER.  SO SAY "PLOVER", THEN "NE", "GET PYRAMID", "S", "LAMP OFF",
"DROP LAMP", "DROP SILVER", "DROP PYRAMID", "GET EMERALD", "W", "DROP EMERALD",
"BACK".  THE REASON YOU DID ALL OF THAT WAS THAT THE ONLY WAY TO GET THE
EMERALD OUT OF THE PLOVER ROOM IS OUT THROUGH THE CRACK, BUT YOU CAN NOT CARRY
ANYTHING ELSE WITH YOU.

NOW "GET LAMP", "GET SILVER", "GET PYRAMID", THEN "PLOVER" AND "PLUGH".  YOU
ARE NOW BACK IN THE WELLHOUSE, SO DROP OFF YOUR TREASURES SO FAR.  TYPE "DROP
SILVER", "DROP PYRAMID".  BACK TO THE CAVE WITH "XYZZY", AND "LAMP ON", "E",
"GET CAGE", "W", "GET ROD", "W", "W","DROP ROD", "GET BIRD", "GET ROD", "W",
"D","W", "WAVE ROD".  THERE IS NOW A CRYSTAL BRIDGE ACROSS THE CHASM.  CONTINUE
WITH "DROP ROD", THEN GO "W", "GET DIAMONDS", "E", "E", "S", "GET GOLD", "N",
"D".  AT THIS POINT YOU WILL SEE A HUGE GREEN SNAKE BARING YOUR WAY.  TO BE RID
OF THE SNAKE, "DROP BIRD", AND THE SNAKE IS DRIVEN AWAY.

AT THIS POINT I NEED TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING ELSE.  DURING THE COURSE OF THE
GAME, A DWARF WILL SEEK YOU OUT AND THROW AN AXE AT YOU.  GET THE AXE.	THE
NEXT TIME YOU SEE THE DWARF, THROW THE AXE AT HIM TO KILL HIM.	THIS MAY HAPPEN
SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.

CONTINUE WITH "DROP CAGE", "SW", "W".  HERE IS A DRAGON SITTING ON A PERSIAN
RUG.  YOU NEED TO KILL THE DRAGON TO GET THE RUG SO TYPE "KILL DRAGON".  THE
GAME WILL RESPOND WITH "WITH WHAT?  YOUR BARE HANDS?".  ANSWER "YES".
CONGRATULATIONS, YOU HAVE NOW KILLED THE DRAGON!.  SO, "GET RUG", THEN "E",
"E", "S", "GET JEWELRY", "N", "W", "GET COINS", "E", "N", "N", "LAMP OFF", AND
"PLUGH".  YOU ARE AGAIN BACK IN THE WELLHOUSE, SO DROP YOUR TREASURES WITH
"DROP DIAMONDS", "DROP GOLD", "DROP RUG", "DROP JEWELRY", "DROP COINS".  BACK
TO THE CAVE WITH "PLUGH", THEN "LAMP ON", "S", "GET FOOD", "GET KEYS", "GET
BOTTLE", "D", "W", "D", "W", "W", THEN SAY "ORIENTAL" TO GET TO THE ORIENTAL
ROOM.  THEN "GET VASE", "W", "DROP KEYS", "DROP FOOD", "BACK", "N", "W", AND
YOU HAVE NOW FOUND THE EMERALD YOU PREVIOUSLY PLACED THERE.  SO "GET EMERALD",
"NW", "S", "SE", "E", "GET PILLOW".  THE PILLOW IS USED TO PLACE THE VASE ON,
SO YOU DON'T BREAK IT.

NOW GO "BACK", "W", "W", "D", "WATER PLANT", "U".  THE PLANT IS CRYING FOR MORE
WATER, SO NOW YOU NEED TO GO GET IT SOME WATER.  BUT BEFORE YOU DO THAT DROP
OFF YOUR TREASURES AT THE WELL- HOUSE BY GOING "E", "E", "NE", "E", "U", "E",
"U", "N", "LAMP OFF", "PLUGH" AND YOU ARE BACK IN THE WELLHOUSE.  SO "DROP
PILLOW", "DROP VASE", "DROP EMERALD".

BACK TO THE CAVE WITH "PLUGH", "LAMP ON", "S", "D", "E", "D", "FILL BOTTLE".
YOUR BOTTLE IS NOW FILLED WITH WATER, SO GO "U", "W", "W", "D", "W", "W", "W",
"W", "D", "WATER PLANT", "U", "E", "D", "GET OIL", "U", "W", "D".  NOW YOU CAN
CLIMB THE BEANSTALK SO, "CLIMB", "W", "GET EGGS", "N", "OIL DOOR", "DROP
BOTTLE", "N", "GET TRIDENT", "W", "D", "DROP TRIDENT", "GET KEYS", "GET FOOD",
"SW", "U".  YOU ARE NOW IN FRONT OF A BRIDGE WITH A TROLL GUARDING IT.  THE
ONLY THING THAT WILL CAUSE THE TROLL TO LEAVE IS TO THROW HIM A TREASURE.
THERE IS ONLY ONE TREASURE YOU CAN THROW HIM AND THAT IS THE EGGS.  SO "THROW
EGGS", THEN "CROSS".

YOU ARE NOW ACROSS THE CHASM.  CONTINUE WITH "NE", "E", "NE", "E", "GET
SPICES", "W", "N", (HERE IS THE VOLCANO), "S", "S", "SE", "S", "IN".  YOU ARE
NOW IN A ROOM WITH A FEROCIOUS BEAR, WHO IS LOCKED UP WITH A GOLD CHAIN.  YOU
NEED TO GET THE CHAIN, SO "FEED BEAR", THEN "UNLOCK" THE CHAIN, "GET BEAR",
"GET CHAIN", "DROP KEYS", AND "OUT".  THE BEAR WILL NOW FOLLOW YOU WHEREVER YOU
GO.  SO GO "U", "U", "W", "W", AND "CROSS".  FROM NOWHERE, THE TROLL APPEARS
AGAIN.	JUST "DROP BEAR", AND THE TROLL WILL DISAPPEAR.  NOW "CROSS" THE
BRIDGE, THEN GO "SW", "D", "GET TRIDENT", "SE", "SE", "NE", "E", "N".  YOU ARE
IN THE CLAM ROOM, SO NOW "OPEN CLAM".  (IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE THE TRIDENT
BEFORE YOU CAN OPEN THE CLAM).	NOW YOU NEED TO GO AFTER THE PEARL SO GO "D",
"D", "GET PEARL".  THEN "U", "U", "S", "U", "E", "U", "N", "LAMP OFF", AND SAY
"PLUGH".  THEN "DROP CHAIN", "DROP PEARL", "DROP TRIDENT", "DROP SPICES".

BACK TO THE CAVE WITH "PLUGH", THEN "LAMP ON", "S", "D", "W", "D", "W", "W",
"W", "W", "D", "CLIMB", "W".  YOU ARE NOW BACK AT THE SPOT WHERE YOU ORIGINALLY
FOUND THE EGGS WHICH YOU THREW TO THE TROLL.  THE REASON YOU THREW THE EGGS WAS
BECAUSE YOU CAN GET THEM BACK AGAIN!  JUST SAY "FEE", "FIE", "FOE", "FOO", AND
THEY MAGICALLY APPEAR!	SO "GET EGGS", THEN "N", "N", "W", "D", "SE", "SE",
"NE", "E", "U", "E", "U", "N", "LAMP OFF", AND "PLUGH".  THEN "DROP EGGS".

NOW ON TO FIND THE LAST TREASURE, THE PIRATE'S CHEST!  GO THERE WITH "PLUGH",
"LAMP ON", "E", "U", "W", "W", "W", "S", "E", "S", "S", "S", "N", "E", "E",
"NW", "GET CHEST", "BACK", "N", "D", "E", "E", "XYZZY".  YOU ARE BACK AT THE
BUILDING, SO "DROP CHEST".  CONGRATULATIONS, YOU NOW HAVE ALL 15 TREASURES!

AT THIS POINT YOU HAVE ONE MORE THING TO ACCOMPLISH BEFORE YOU GO THE THE GRAND
FINALE.  SO SAY "XYZZY", THEN GO "W", "W", "W", "D", "D", "N", "D", "W", "D",
"E", "GET MAGAZINES".  YOUR QUEST IS TO TAKE THE MAGAZINES, AND PLACE THEM JUST
INSIDE WITT'S END.  THIS ACTION IS OFTEN MISSED BY PEOPLE PLAYING THIS GAME,
AND AS A RESULT, THEY DO NOT FINISH THE GAME WITH ALL 350 POINTS AND THE GRAND
MASTER STATUS.	NOW GO "E", THEN "DROP MAGAZINES", AND "BACK".

NOW COMES THE EASY PART, JUST WANDER AROUND THESE PASSAGES, AS YOU NOW HAVE
SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".
WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IS PLACED A STICK OF DYNAMITE AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE
ROOM.  NOW YOU SAY THE MAGIC WORD - "BLAST".  YOU HAVE NOW EXPLODED A HOLE IN
THE FAR WALL, AND YOU MARCH THROUGH IT INTO THE MAIN OFFICE.  YOU HAVE NOW
FINISHED THE GAME OF ADVENTURE!
